Thus, the instructor may choose to set aside class time for students to discuss and complete these final steps of the lesson, or create breakout rooms/virtual meeting links for group members to meet and work on annotations. If none of those options are available, students may also generate annotations independently in Google Sheets, then review other students’ annotations, comment about observations they had, and return to their own annotations and adapt them as necessary."
